                        My long term goal is to work in the technology sector. I would love to either teach, build websites or make video games.

                        <p>My strength would be my ability to be able to pick things up and be able to use them to a satisfactory standard. I see myself as a bit of a Jack of All trades but master of none. However this has also become a bit of a limitation for myself as well as I find myself not being able to dig deeper than the surface and becoming to pre-occupied with trying to understand whats under hood that I end up going off on long tangents instead of just continuely working to understand it properly.</p>

                        <p>A more human skill I would like to pick up would be to be a bit more assertive. I am ussually a bit of a shy person, I used to be a bit out going but as of late I've retreated a lot more to within myself.</p> 
                    </div>
                    <div class="container">
                        <p>I will manage myself by being attentive and trying to participate in the course discourse more. I've read everyones introductions and also when I see someone that might need help I ask even if the others have responded to the thread if they need help. By doing this I want to show that I am buying into this method of learning.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="container">
                        <p>When things build up and starting getting to me. I would try to solve the issue on my own but if its not possible or if I get to stuck I will reach out to my facillitator for help. I've felt like I've already learnt a bit from him. Like he said in a work setting you can't spend to much time trying to figure something out because you are being paid to do the work not to learn.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="container">
                        <p>I don't want to be stuck on things for too long. Depending on the subject will depend on whether I ask for help sooner or later. I don't really have any expectations of the facilitation team. However I will note this is one of the first times I've joined a course with the intention of actually asking for help if I get stuck. In my previous learning situations I've always felt to embarrassed to ask for help as I use to view this as weakness. From the self learning I've done lately about not only coding but personal self development. Asking for help can be one of the most courageous things you can do. It takes a lot to put your pride in your pocket and to ask for help.</p>

                        <p>I don't have any other commitments besides my day job. However as discussed with the admissions team when the bootcamp comes I will be quitting work to be able to pursue the bootcamp with my utmost ability so that I can get the best possible outcome. Anything that I might have to address or that might come up I will give the facillitator notice in advance.</p>

                            I'm hoping to use the skills I gain during this bootcamp to positively add to the workforce. I don't particularly have a destination in mind however I have been look at jump boards so I can get a more focused idea on what jobs are potentially out there by the time I finish this course.

                        <p>
                            Biggest strength in bootcamp will be that I can fully focus on it because I've quit my job so that there are no other distractions. A limitation I could possibly have could be my poor time management skills, however I worked from 8 to 430 everyday previously so now this would fill that time up. My original strengths and weakness were around the fact that I am a jack of all trades in a way. They have changed slightly I still think this will still be a strength but in bootcamp I'll be able to be more focused than when I was doing foundations.

                            Dealing with anxiety and feeling inadequate with my abilities. As my anxiety usually causes me to seek refuge in doing other things then doing the work and succeeding. So I guess it would leak into keeping focused for the 9 weeks.

                    <div class="container">
                        <p>
                            I believe that what I put in the first learning plan still holds the same value for me today. Being a bit more assertive with my thoughts. Not in a mean or condescending way but rather being able to voice an opinion and to not be afraid of what others think of that. Rather to be curageous enough to put the idea out there and for it to be tested and questioned by others without feeling like rather than the idea that is being questioned that it is me being questioned. I hope by doing this I'll be able to be a bit more of a leader.

                        <p>
                            I don't really have any expectations of the Bootcamp team. I don't know if this is good or bad. Rather I'm trying more to take ownership of my own expectation of others however I expect of myself to reach out for help when needed as this is something I've never really been good at. I guess I could say that I expect the Bootcamp team to allow me to be vulnerable.

                            I expect myself to have a good understanding of what it might be like to work in tech. To ask for help in a timely manner. But most important to take extreme ownership for what I wish to gain out of this experience.
