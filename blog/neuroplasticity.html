                    At its core Neutoplacticity is about how the brain can continue to learn even going into old age. The brain is made up of billions upon billions of neurons. When we go to learn something new these neurons fire to create connections with other neurons to to build and retain synaptic connections. The more often a person can fire and use those synpatic connections the strong the connections become the easier it is to recall and use that information. This also means that the opposite is true and the old age adage of use it or lose it is also true. That after learning new skills if you do not spend any time fostering those skills you will eventually lose them. The benefit for this as well is that old bad habits can eventually be conquered and then removed from the pathway.

                    As someone who sees themselves as a person that loves to practise and learn all sorts of things its really opened my mind up to how th brain physically works. For the past year and a bit I've done a bit of meditating and praying. I've found that prayer and meditation activate the same parts of the brain. Through doing this I've been able to anchor my days and give myself immense amounts of peace. You might at this point be wondering why this would help? When your in a more peaceful state of mind learning becomes all most effortless. You feel like the walls in your way are just crumbling. The benefit to this is that it makes it easier for the repeition that takes place when coding to build on and strengthen the synapses. Having an Aha! moment can only take you so far its the building repetitions that will get you the rest of the way. A part of my daily routine at the moment as an example is using Git Bash. I have a laptop upstairs and down stairs. So every day I am Git adding, Git Commiting, Git Pushing and Git Pulling to build those synaptic connections. Which in turn has helped to make me feel fairly comfortable with using Git.

            <h3>What is the Growth Mindset and how is it revelant?</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    The Growth Mindset is a way of thinking. As the name implies its a mindset. A book called the Mindset by Carol S. Dweck explores this in far greater detail. However today I will give you a small overview of it. To understand it better, its best to discuss what the opposite to it is. Which is a fixed mindset. The idea of a fixed mindset is about how one takes on challenges in life, and how they view themselves in relation to those challenges. A good example would be someone that walks into a brick wall. In a fixed mindset the idea that a brick wall is infront of you and you cannot move forward. They would stay stuck in this position. They would'nt move for as far as the are concerned this is it. There is nothing that can be done about this. However a growth mindset would be someone who would approach the brick wall. Test it by pushing on it looking around it and seeing if there are other ways to get past this obstacle. More often times than not there is and they make it through. The power of the Growth mindset really relies on trying to grow in relation to the challenge that lays ahead rather than to recoil and freeze. It is revelant especially for a discipline like coding because there will be many a times when problem solving code that it can feel like theres nothing you can do and are powerless to move past the code brick in your way.

            <h3>Suprises, Changes and Intergration of the Growth Mindset into the Learning Journey!</h3>
            <div class="container">           
                <p>
                    I've listened to the book mindset in the past and have found that a lot of my way of thinking prior to even reading this book has been that of a growth mindset. I've always believed at a young age that anything could be learned or gained through spending time doing it. When I think about this I wonder if it might have something to do with the kinds of cartoon's I'd watch as a kid. They always had characters that were down on their luck but never gave up. Always pushed forward towards their goals such as Naruto or Goku as examples. I think the biggest changes for myself after listening to it was that it gave a more academic voice to my approach and helped me to understand that way of thinking from that world view. The biggst takeaway of the Growth Minset that has helped my approach in learning over the past 2 years is that your ability to pass or fail something is not based upon you as a person. Its not attached to you as an immutable part of your character. Rather it is that at the time you did not have the correct tools to be able to do the job. The Growth Minset teaches us that we can work with what we have to solve problems and solving problems is great. But success or failure cannot be the way you measure it but rather the way that you approached it and gave it the best of your ability at that time. As they say as long as you know you left it all out on the field, you can't be unhappy with that!
