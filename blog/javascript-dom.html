        <h3>JavaScript and the DOM</h3>
        <p> 
            <h4>Whats the differences between HTML and CSS?</h4>
            <div class="container">
                
                    <p>
                The difference between HTML and CSS is that HTML is used more as a way to structure the layout of the website. It's job as the it's name suggests is to markup a website. To put things into place. CSS on the other hand is used to dress up the websites to improve the viewing and interactive experience of the user. A great analogy would be the building of a house. HTML would be the layout of a house, its beams and structures. What the layout of where the rooms, the lounge and the kitchen would go. Once the house is built you would then design the inside of the house to suit the needs of those that would live in the house. This would be the analogy for CSS. What colour the walls would be, how the rooms would be setup with furniture or what kind of plants to plant in the garden.

            <h4>Control Flow and Loops</h4>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    The control flow in simple terms is how a programmes carries out the work its been told to do in an order. An analogy for this would be the process of building a car. For instance a car hads, windows, a chassy, wheels, car seats etc. Most car manufacturing has the car run through a set process and at the end a car comes out. Using this analogy it also makes it easy to explain statements like switch, if and if else. The switch statement in the car analogy would be decided which type of car it would be. You can create a switch statement that if the car is a 4 wheel drive it would be taken down the 4 wheel drive path or if it were a sudan it would go down that path. At this next point you could write an if statement to say if the car has passed its structural integrity to be moved on to the next phase. At the end to catch any cars that don't you could use if else to send cars that don't meat standard to the scrap heap. Once it's passed these phases you could put the car through a paint loop. Where the car goes through a painting process, at the end of the process the car gets checked. If the car passes it exits the loop if it fails it continues in the loop till it meets a satisfactory standard to exit the loop for that car.

            <h4>What the DOM!?!?!</h4>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    The DOM is a tree of objects.  The best way to describe it is by looking at a tree, the tree has a trunk, the trunk grows out into big branches. Off those big branches come smaller branches. The DOM is similar where the DOM is the trunk, The first item off the trunk is the HTML tag. Then that branches off into the head and body tags. So on and so forth. The way one might interact with the DOM is say for instance your wanting to find a specific ID. You would use the method document.getElementById(''). What this will do is that it will go back up the branch all the way back through to the trunk. On the way it will pick any ID's that match the one you are looking for. It will then bring those back to apply any changes that you are making to them.

            <h4>What's the difference between arrays and objects?   </h4>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                In Javascript an object is used to represent a thing. An example of this would be if you stored a name: john. They are stored in whats called value pairs. On the other hand arrays also store values however are done in a way that is called ordered collection. This means you can access the items stored in the array through whats called a numerical index. A good analogy would be have papers on your desk. Yes they would be objects with different things on each and yes they would be there. However pages can get confused between each other and things can go wrong when they don't have a place. An array on the otherhand would be like having a filing cabinent for those papers. You can neatly store your papers in the filing cabinet and when you need those papers again you can open the filing cabinet to a certain number and then pull the paper.

            <h4>What are functions and why are they useful?</h4>
            <div class="container">           
                <p>
                    A function would be a peice of code that would carry out a specific task. They are useful because instead of having to write the same code everywhere you could just write out the function. This would take the programme to where the function is stored, excute what the function is then return to where it was at point of the code that the function snippet was on. An analogy for this would be whipped cream. You could take cream home and whip the cream yourself or you could buy whipped cream in a can so that it could be used right away.
