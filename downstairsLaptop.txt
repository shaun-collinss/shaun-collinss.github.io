thinking like a programer and Flipped Learning

My approach to things has always been that I like to break things down to small parts so they dont seem as hard anymore. I love to problem solve things, But I couldnt really see the link between coding and problem solving as after this short week ive spent to much time on trying to learn code rather than realising that the better practise would be to solve the problem and then find the corresponding code to do the job. I like to think if I have a bigger toolkit I can better do the job. But sometimes just knowing what tool is needed first might be the better option. Flipped learning is an interesting concept. I feel as though I have experienced this way of learning through going through other university courses however it just was not given a name.

Wife - My husband is a very kind, loving man. He loves Jesus Christ and myself and our child very much. He can be very very stubborn and lazy but there isnt anything he would not do for us.

Sister - I've always seen my brother as an independent person. He is the youngest of our bunch of 7 but because of him being the youngest he also had to grow up the fastest. He has been a great uncle to our little ones and helped to raise them, they are now adults as well. When I was younger there were more of us at home. In my brothers youth for the most part it was him home with our parents, and also our sister after she had been diagnosed with schtophrenia and bi-polar. Even through those times who always stayed cool calm and collected. He didn't complain to much about it and got on with things. I am proud of my brothers achievements with his bachelors degree, his marriage and his son. The core value my brother has is love and loyalty.

Friend - Yeah Good cunt.

Matthew 16:24-26 KJV

-I come from a Catholic Samoan home. My parents are God fearing, people loving people. My parents were apart of the Samoan community at church. My parents values really came across to me when I would see how much they would do care for each other. My parents had a humility to them which was apart of their own up bringing.
