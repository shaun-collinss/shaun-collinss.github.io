            <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
            <h2>My long term goal is to work in the technology sector. I would love to either teach, build websites or make video games.</h2>

            <p>My strength would be my ability to be able to pick things up and be able to use them to a satisfactory standard. I see myself as a bit of a Jack of All trades but master of none. However this has also become a bit of a limitation for myself as well as I find myself not being able to dig deeper than the surface and becoming to pre-occupied with trying to understand whats under hood that I end up going off on long tangents instead of just continuely working to understand it properly.</p>


            <p>A more human skill I would like to pick up would be to be a bit more assertive. I am ussually a bit of a shy person, I used to be a bit out going but as of late I've retreated a lot more to within myself.</p> 


            <p>I will manage myself by being attentive and trying to participate in the course discourse more. I've read everyones introductions and also when I see someone that might need help I ask even if the others have responded to the thread if they need help. By doing this I want to show that I am buying into this method of learning.</p>

            <p>When things build up and starting getting to me. I would try to solve the issue on my own but if its not possible or if I get to stuck I will reach out to my facillitator for help. I've felt like I've already learnt a bit from him. Like he said in a work setting you can't spend to much time trying to figure something out because you are being paid to do the work not to learn.</p>

            <p>I don't want to be stuck on things for too long. Depending on the subject will depend on whether I ask for help sooner or later. I don't really have any expectations of the facilitation team. However I will note this is one of the first times I've joined a course with the intention of actually asking for help if I get stuck. In my previous learning situations I've always felt to embarrassed to ask for help as I use to view this as weakness. From the self learning I've done lately about not only coding but personal self development. Asking for help can be one of the most courageous things you can do. It takes a lot to put your pride in your pocket and to ask for help.</p>

            <p>I don't have any other commitments besides my day job. However as discussed with the admissions team when the bootcamp comes I will be quitting work to be able to pursue the bootcamp with my utmost ability so that I can get the best possible outcome. Anything that I might have to address or that might come up I will give the facillitator notice in advance.</p>
