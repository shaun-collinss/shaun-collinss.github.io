                <h3>What surprised me the most about learning core is?</h3>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        Here's my 2 minute blub:
                        Learning core for me would have been surprising if I hadnt been spending the better part of the past 2 years trying to discover what makes me tick and why I am afraid of going after the goals I have for myself.<span></span>

                        I think the more surpising thing I learnt would be that I am not as alone as I thought in regards to this. Because of that factor its given me more time to reflect on my own insecurities in a way. When you operate as an island its easy to be so intent on the small minute details of your own life but readings other peoples life journey's has helped me to come to a point where I can appreciate my own more.

                <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        How much my Pride impedes me. How it affects my view of myself and how others view me. Its something I've known but its not something I've paid attention to when i'm in a place where putting myself out there to be viewed by others. From a young age I've always been viewed as someone that can do cool things and that's become a part of my persona so when I fail, I think that there is something wrong with me when I now know that is not the case. Anxiety and realising it and overcoming it. I noticied it when deadlines were coming up and it made me a bit un-predicatable because I knew what had to be done and I was putting it off. I also this time around decided instead of trying to run away from it rather to sit with it feel it and then to overcome it. Doing this made me realise that I have control over it, and thus there is nothing to fear. The 3rd thing I learnt more in-depth about is neuroplasticity in regards to learning about the brain receptors.

                <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        I believe their role is to allow people to be vulnerable enough to realise that they do not know everything and that it is ok to be this way. Especially when it comes to something like programming and technology as things are always changing. It's like a microcosm of the world in a way. Holding to your values so that you do not lose who you are at your core while things change but having the empathy and self awareness to be kind enough to yourself and to others.

                <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        What surprised me the most about core was learning how a lot of these concepts align with my personal values as a Catholic Christian. I've read books from Jordan b Petersen to Tim Ferris. I've listened to podcasts from people like Jokco Willink, Brene Brown to Sam Harris. At the core of most of the messaging is that you should be kind to one another and to forgive yourself. In forgiving yourself you free yourself to move forward and to improve your life and that of those around you.

                <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        The most challenging portion of this for me was actually deciding what it was that I wanted to do after this. I have a fair idea of what I want to do but not entirely sure on how to get there.

                <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        I've been on a huge learning journey of self discovery and self mastery. At the beggining of 2020 I had a heart attack and thus things that were important became all most laser focused. The previous times I had studied I had always been kind of afraid to share who I really am with others. In fear of judgement, hurting my pride and ego. This time around I am trying my best to wear my heart on my sleeve and I feel like doing this and spending less time worrying has helped greatly. From this viewpoint I can understand why focusing on the person is far more important as code can be taught fairly quickly but having people know where their true north is, is not something that businesses or companies would have the time to be able to help people develop. Being humble and having a learners heart can take the individual a long way and I believe thats why core learning is so important.

                <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        In my circumstance I wouldn't say it was a waste of time as reinforcing learnt knowledge can always be a bonus so I would not say it was wasting time. Practising programming or anything really is always time well spent however if your unsure of its purpose it can feel aimless, all most formless. Practise for practise sake isn't bad but it can be monotomous. With core learning, understanding where your faults are in your personality can help to make practise more fruitful as it will help you to see where your ego is getting in the way of further advancement.
