                <h3>Why is Code readability is important?</h4>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        The purpose of making your code readable is so that others that come along are able to read your code more easily. Thus do not have to spend long periods trying to work out what each portion of your code does. This also makes it easier for code to be edited when needed. Identation is a nice and easy way to make your code readable outside of adding comments. 
                    </p>

                <h3>What is DRY?</h3>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        <h2>DRY - Don't repeat yourself</h2>
                        <p>
                            What this means is that where possible you should refractor your code into a function or method to be recalled when needed rather than writing out new code each time. The greatest reason why you would do this is that if you need to change something instead of going and changing each individually which would consume a lot of time you could just change a single method which would change it throughout the rest of your code.

                            <p>
                                Creating a simple function that would read a number and say yes or no if it matched that number.

                                I learnt that I was getting to stuck into trying to make the code more simple. Instead of letting it go and leaving it as it is

                                I feel very confident using them, they break things down where it doesnt seem as difficult.

                        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
                        <div>
                            This is a way of writing code out in plain text. A great example of this would be something like. Walks treasure chest. Open treasure chest. Take treasure. Close treasure chest. I am walking through how the code should work. In code it would look something like. Keypad.Press(W){move players x amount of space}. Keypad.Press(A){if player standing next to object, interact}. UI{Opens up the menu for player to take item}. Exit UI{}.
                        </div>
                        <h3>Trying something</h3>
                        <div>
                            Testing out code to see if it works.
                        </div>
                        <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
                        <div>
                            Talking to a rubber duck like talking to a person and explaining your code to them
                        </div>
                        <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
                        <div>
                            Reading the error messages and working your way backward to solving a coding issue
                        </div>
                        <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
                        <div>
                            By using console.log you are able to see whether or not your code works by using this method, if you meet the condition it will log it otherwise if it does not log it would show you solution does not work.
                        </div>
                        <h3>Googling</h3>
                        <div>
                            Taking a portion of code you are unsure about and searching the inter webs for answers.
                        </div>
                        <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
                        <div>
                            This is super helpful as a friend might have already completed and then they could explain it to you in a better manner
                        </div>
                        <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
                        <div>
                            Should be a last resort, but as they are the master and you are the student they should be able to help you to an answer.
                        </div>
                        <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
                        <div>
                            Reflecting upon what has been done helps to solidify the neural pathways and strengthen them to be able to call upon what you've learnt.
