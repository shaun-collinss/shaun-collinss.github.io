            <h1>Identity Values</h1>
            <h2>Core Personal Values</h2>

            <p>My core personal values come from Jesus Christ, and from my parents. Treat others as how you would like to be treated. Love your enemies. The core personel values that I value the most are honesty, loyalty, and empathy.</p>


            <p>I personally believe the human body can pretty much heal anything on its own for the most part. This comes from my belief in the laws of nature created by our creator. When I had my mini heart attack and ended up in hospital. I was afraid and scared. My wife was recently pregnant with our first child. It was the first time in a long time I had fell into despair and sadness. Most of my loved ones would say I'm pretty happy guy for the most part and don't really let much get me down. I believe that the Lord always has a plan. When things went wrong I just would think that this must be for my benefit some how. Due to the heart attack I had a hard time believing in my faith that had guided me so far. I was posed with a choice, without any evidence of needing it. But was told to get a stent put into my chest. No angio had been done yet or any kind of test to see if there was even a blockage in the first place. My wife was worried and fair enough she was pregnant, she thought I should do it. I decided to make an ethical choice at the moment to trust in my gut and to trust the Lord. I said no to the stint. It sounds crazy I know, In a state of fear a lot of suggestions sound like good ones till your more clear headed. They then said they could give me a stint that was biodegradable which for me sounded great and I said I would be interested in that one. As they were going to put the stint in at the same time as they did the angio. They actually found that my coronary artieries were absolutely fine. I did not need a stint at all. However the consequences of that decision was that the doctors and nursing staff were less kind to me after that point. It was at this point I realised that no one will care more about your health than you will, atleast I knew that I could trust my own decisions.</p> 


            <p>I come from a Catholic Samoan home. My parents are God fearing, people loving people. My parents were apart of the Samoan community at church. My parents values really came across to me when I would see how much they would care for each other. My parents had a humility to them which was apart of their own up bringing. The Samoan culture is one of hospitality to others. To its core its about love and service, My father was firm with me sometimes but as an adult I look back and relize that it was out of love for me. By disciplining me he taught me what it meant to serve others and also showed me he wasnt above doing menial tasks either like washing dishes, cooking or mowing the lawn. This was a part of Samoan culture for me as its a community everyone helps each other out.</p>

            <p>Some qoutes that resonate with me.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind" Timothy 1:7 KJV</li>
                <li>"Good" - Jocko Willink</li>
                <li>"Vulnerability is not about winning, and its not about losing. It's about having the courage to show up and be seen" Brene Brown</li>
                <li>"No matter what your current ability is, effort is what ignites that ability and turns it into accomplishment" Carol S. Dweck</li>
                <li>"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength" Marcus Aurelius</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>strengths and limitations.</h2>

            <p>My strengths are patience, team player, open to conversation. My biggest strength is being a team player. My biggest limitation is not knowing when to ask for help. I am really good at providing help to people in my team. However I am really poor in receiving help or asking for it.</p>
            <p>In regards to my strengths for learning, I love to be able to just sit with things and try to figure them out. That's why I think I am a good team player as I'll take on tasks that other people don't want to do. However the limiting thing to this is that I would have a wide array of knowledge, but not enough deep knowledge to feel like I could actually be effective in doing that work if someone was to hire me for it.</p>

            <p>Being a team player, it becomes an obstacle when I don't know when to say I can't do that as I have not finished learning the prior thing.</p>

            <p>When I was at media design school. I was in a team with an artist that was a bit of a perfectionist. This caused tension as he would get upset with us about our work or would just ignore us. To his defense he did have aspergers so it was hard for him to be able to socialize with us so that we could understand him better. To help the team I developed the strategy of taking on the extra work because he felt that I could get close enough to his style. However I was also helping in other areas such as sound, particles and many more. It worked, we got through the year and produced a good game. However I didn't do very well on personal projects as I had taken on to much. Looking back I think the best approach would have been to have the team sit down with each other and have an actually discussion so that we could figure out more succinctly to what that team member needed to be able to do his job.
