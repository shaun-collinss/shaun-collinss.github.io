        <p>
            <span>I looked over this question as I think its a very important one to be able to understand. When I first started doing some HTML I didnt quite understand what the difference was. This can become a huge problemn if thought about for to long. Especially when starting out.

            The best way to describe them would be thinking about your intent what you want to accomplish. Before adding them you should ask yourself will this item be unique or will it be similar to other items? This is a good question to ask when deciding which one to use as it can save you a lot of hassle in the long run.</span>

            <span>The best example for a class would be something that would come up numerous times throughout the creating your website. A great real world example would be a cheesecake shop, because who doesnt really like cheesecakes. A class would be similar to a types of cakes available in the shop. You can have a cheesecake or a normal cake. Each of them would be considered different classes of cakes. When you buy a cheesecake you know it will have cream cheese in it and a crust.

            The use of ID's on the other hand would be more similar to specialty items. Items that don't quite fit a class and are more likely to only be one of them or very few. In regards to this the cheesecake shop analogy would be like making a cheese cake that is a birthday cake and is also keto friendly, so doesn't have any ingredients that would up the carb count. It's unique from the standpoint of it being diet specific and also occasion specific because of the birthday.</span>
